## Invitation to submit sessions on Front-end and Business & Strategy tracks.

Europe is again getting ready for the [DrupalCon](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/), the annual gathering of Drupal dev and business in Europe. This year we are playing a home game since the conference will be held in Barcelona!

We are helping out with the program and would like to invite you to submit sessions for the [Front-end](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/tracks#front-end) and [Business and Strategy](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/tracks/#business-and-strategy) tracks. The deadline for proposal submission is *8 June midnight CEST*, so don't hesitate further and [submit a session](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/submit-session)!

## Front end track

Our own João Belchior is the front-end track chair. He is looking for sessions that inspire and excite front end developers to share their stories, from their favourite tools and frameworks to topics like typography or solving new design problems.

## Business & Strategy track

Together with [Dagmar Muth from Amazee Labs](http://www.amazeelabs.com/en/dagmar-muth), I will be helping out with the Business & Strategy track. We are looking for sessions on business diversification, growth, processes and resource planning, but also on company & team culture, distributed teams or digital nomads. The track is aimed at attendees looking for ideas and challenges from business owners, executives and project managers on how to manage a Drupal business in a successful way.
