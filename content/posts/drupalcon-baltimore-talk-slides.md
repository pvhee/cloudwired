## Presenting our story of rebuilding rednoseday.com on Drupal 8 at DrupalCon Baltimore, Drupal's largest gathering with over 3000 attendees.

Two weeks ago, I presented our story of rebuilding [rednoseday.com](https://www.rednoseday.com/) on Drupal 8 at [DrupalCon Baltimore](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/building-reusable-websites-drupal-8-lessons-learned-transforming), Drupal's largest gathering with an attendance of over 3000!

I talked about our journey of building a product to power all our editorial websites at Comic Relief ([see my previous blog post](https://technology.comicrelief.com/2016/12/21/building-rednoseday-com-on-drupal-8/)), and focused on three topics: *editor experience, automation & streamlining*, and *using decoupled services*.

So far, our product ecosystem proudly powers [www.rednoseday.com](https://www.rednoseday.com/), and the upcoming [Red Nose Day USA Campaign](http://rednoseday.org/), and we are currently working hard to bring [www.comicrelief.com](https://www.comicrelief.com/) on board as well!
