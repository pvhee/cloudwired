We love to make our office a cosy place that makes us feel at home and inspires us. With that in mind, we asked graphical artist [Gijs Vanhee](http://www.gijsvanhee.be/) — who previously created our logo — to redesign our office. It took him a couple of days and a whole series of light-blue [Posca paint markers](http://www.posca.com/uk), but we think the result looks awesome!

Gijs Vanhee is my brother, and you can find most of his work all over Belgium. Check [his website](http://www.gijsvanhee.be/), or read [this recent interview](http://creativenestlings.com/conversations/gijs-vanhee/) by Creative Nestlings. Thanks a lot Gijs for making us proud!
