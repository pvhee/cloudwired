## Europe's major developer-oriented Drupal event, with over 300 attendants and 30 high-quality sessions.

The [Drupal Developer Days](http://barcelona2012.drupaldays.org/) are the major developer-oriented event organized in Europe. With over 300 attendants and 30 high-quality sessions on topics such as Drupal 8, e-commerce, mapping, search and automization, we could not miss the event.

Prior to the conference, we participated in the [Improve Mapping in Drupal 7](http://barcelona2012.drupaldays.org/improve-mapping-drupal-7) sprint, which ultimately led to the integration of Views in the promising [Leaflet module](https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet) (read our [blog post](https://marzeelabs.org/blog/2012-09-08-introducing-leaflet-for-drupal)). Thanks a lot to [dasjo](http://www.drupal.org/user/228295) and all the participants for organizing this very productive sprint!

At the end of the conference we organized a ["chill out pica-pica"](http://barcelona2012.drupaldays.org/fiesta) in front of our new Marzee Labs office in the marina of Barcelona. With cold beer and salty cakes prepared by [Anne Campagna](https://twitter.com/annecampagna), the event was a relaxed and pleasant ending to a great conference. We are already looking forward to the next Drupal Developer Days.
